# CadutaLiberaTheGame
This is a game i made in december 2020 in Java, it's not one of the best but it's my first "long" project

This is a real TV game show in italy and i tried to recreate it

**Gameplay**
+ you have to guess the word by reading the hints above
+ you have 3 min to give all the 10 answers or you lose

**P.S** i know the code is messy and bad
